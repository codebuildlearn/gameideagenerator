# Game Idea Generator

This is the repository for the Game Idea Generator tool hosted at [https://www.codebuildlearn.com/tools/gameideagenerator](https://www.codebuildlearn.com/tools/gameideagenerator).

## Mission

The Game Idea Generator tool's goal is to provide a simple way for game developers to quickly come up with interesting and unique game ideas that spark creativity and free the developer to practice the art of making games rather than becoming paralyzed by the process of deciding on the perfect game idea.  

## Purpose

When someone first sets out to become a game developer, one of the commonly recommend suggestions is that you should not attempt to make your dream game as your first game.  The most likely scenario is that your first game will not be all that good.  After all, being a good game designer is a learned skill.  More importantly though, the scope of your dream game is likely rather large.  It will take a long time to complete, and as a new game developer, most of us need successes to keep motivated while learning something challenging like game development.  Because of this fact, most developers who start with their dream game as their first attempt at game development never finish the project.  A better approach is to start small, and get into the habbit of not only finishing games, but releasing them.  Receiving feedback about your games is an invaluable resource in the journey to becoming a game developer, and that only comes when you put your game in players' hands.  So if you aren't going to make your dream game as your first few games, then what do you make?  There are a number good of options.  One fun option is to use a **Game Idea Generator**.  Rather than trying to come up with a unique idea yourself, you could allow a generator to come up with game ideas for you at random.  And by giving yourself the constraint of making a simple game based on a randomly generated idea, you free yourself from being paralyzed by the decision of what game to make and focus on a much more important thing: getting in the habbit of making and releasing games!  

## How Does It Work

If you haven't tried it already, the best way to understand the tool is just to try it out at [https://www.codebuildlearn.com/tools/gameideageneartor](https://www.codebuildlearn.com/tools/gameideageneartor).  This simple **Game Idea Generator** tool works by randomly picking these 5 different constraints for your game:

1. Genre
2. Character
3. Game Mechanic
4. Objective / Obstacle
5. Location / Setting

You are able to have the tool choose all 4 of these constraints at random, or any combination of constraints if you would like to decide on of these characteristics yourself, such as the genre.  You are also able to remove any options from these 4 categories from being chosen if that option is not one you would like to be a potentially selected random choice.  For instance, if you plan to only make a 2D game, you may choose to remove First Person Shooter from the potential **Genre** options as FPS games are not typically made in 2D.  The default is to have one of each type of constraint, but you may find some very interesting ideas when you increase the count of some of the constraints.  Because of this,the interface allows you to increase the constraint count for each different game constraint type, which will cause multiple constraints to be generated for that type.  Set the **Genre** constraint count to 2 or more to have the tool generate hybrid genre ideas.  Increase the constraint count for **Character** to inspire unique story and mechanic ideas related to multiple main characters being used in some sort of combination.  Increase the constraint count on **Game Mechanic** to discover unique game mechanic combinations.

## Feedback

Besides the goal of "lifting up the hood" on the tools we provide whenever possible and showing developers how we make these tools so that they can gain from the efforts beyond the actual tools themselves, the primary goal of hosting this repository on GitHub is to utilize the Issues tracker and Pull requests features.  If you have any suggestions on improvements that can me made or have any discovered in problems with the tool, please leave feedback in our [Issues tracker](https://github.com/codebuildlearn/gameideagenerator/issues).  If you are able to make the suggested improvements yourself, we welcome pull requests from the community.  Please do keep in mind, though, that this tool is designed for use by a broad developer community.  Any changes to this tool must adhere to the primary goal of the tool listed in the **Mission** secion.
